/*
Kth array element after M replacements of array elements by XOR of adjacent pairs
Difficulty Level : Easy
Given an array arr[] of size N and two integers M and K, the task is to find the array element at the Kth index after performing following M operations on the given array.

In a single operation, a new array is formed whose elements have the Bitwise XOR values of the adjacent elements of the current array.

If the number of operations M or the value of K after M operations is invalid then print -1.

Examples:

Input: arr[] = {1, 4, 5, 6, 7}, M = 1, K = 2
Output: 3
Explanation:
Since M = 1, therefore, the operation has to be performed only once on the array.
The array is modified to {1^4, 4^5, 5^6, 6^7} = {5, 1, 3, 1}.
The value of the element at index K = 2 in the updated array is 3.



Input: arr[] = {3, 2, 6}, M = 2, K = 1
Output: -1
Explanation:
Since M = 2, operation has be performed twice.
On performing 1st operation on the array {3, 2, 6} it is modified as {3^2, 2^6} = {1, 4}.
On performing 2nd operation on the array {1, 4}, it is modified as {1^4} = {5}.
After performing 2 operations, the size of the array is reduced to 1. This implies that the index K = 1 doesnâ€™t exist after 2 operations.
Hence, the given input is invalid. So the output is -1.
